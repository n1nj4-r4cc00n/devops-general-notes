Kubernetes cluster configurations:

- All-in-One Single-Node Installation
In this setup, all the master and worker components are installed and running on a single-node. While it is useful for learning, development, and testing, it should not be used in production. Minikube is an installation tool originally aimed at single-node cluster installations, and we are going to explore it in future chapters.
- Single-Master and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have a single-master node running a stacked etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the master node.
- Single-Master with Single-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have a single-master node with an external etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the master node.
- Multi-Master and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have multiple master nodes configured for High-Availability (HA), with each master node running a stacked etcd instance. The etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster and, multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA masters.
- Multi-Master with Multi-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have multiple master nodes configured in HA mode, with each master node paired with an external etcd instance. The external etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster, and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA masters. This is the most advanced cluster configuration recommended for production environments.

note: As the Kubernetes cluster's complexity grows, so does its hardware and resources requirements. While we can deploy Kubernetes on a single host for learning, development, and possibly testing purposes, the community recommends multi-host environments that support High-Availability control plane setups and multiple worker nodes for client workload.
